    "Heart disease is a common cause of death in the United States. For every 5 people, 1 will suffer from this condition. Due to the ever-prevalent nature of this disease, we believe it is important to know where one currently stands at the moment. With this project, we aim to predict and classify the severity of heart conditions based upon several variables. With data provided from _____, we are able to train a model based upon 297 rows of data. \n",
